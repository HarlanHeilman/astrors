A package for astronomical image processing and analysis. We aim to provide a simple interface for common tasks like opening fits files, including images and tables.

### To Do list
----------

* [X] Read/Writing modifying header.
* [X] Read/Writing modifying image data.
* [ ] Documentation
* [ ] Read/Writing bin table data.
* [ ] Keep CARD comment
* [X] Support of multiple HDU, fits extensions (in progress, only the header is parsed)
* [ ] WCS operations
* [ ] General astronomy operations

### Docs

For now we are investing on programming the features to add complete docs after. There are multiple examples in the tests.
